# Gerrilar Tools MultiTools Suite (Beta)

**Gerrilar Tools MultiTools Suite** is a comprehensive, all-in-one toolkit developed in Python for advanced users and developers. This beta version offers essential utilities including:

- **EXE Files Python** – Convert your Python (.py) files into standalone executables (.exe) using PyInstaller with additional DLL support.
- **Linkvertise Bypass** – Bypass Linkvertise URLs to reliably extract target URLs.
- **IP Tools** – Check your public IP, evaluate its exposure, and send it to a webhook.
- **Free VPN Launcher** – Open a free VPN website (ProtonVPN) in your default browser.
- **Wireshark Launcher** – Launch Wireshark for network analysis (if installed).
- **Discord Bot Script Generator** – Generate a basic Discord bot script, customizable with your token.
- **AI Assistant Simulation** – A simulated interactive assistant that echoes your inputs.
- **Environment Initialization** – Set up a dedicated folder on your Desktop named `gerrilar tools` and generate all necessary files (logs, README, credentials, DLL files, and subfolders) for the suite’s full functionality.
- **Extension Module** – An additional module that lists the contents of your environment folder, simulates dynamic DLL loading, and launches extended versions of tools like Wireshark.

> **Note:** This project is currently in beta. I plan to release the full version with even more advanced options once this project reaches 110 stars on GitHub.
